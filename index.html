<h1><i>Unlike</i> Anyone Else</h1>

    <p>Armond Arabshahi is an American singer, songwriter, DJ, and record developer who goes by his stage name: Unlike Pluto.</p>
    <p id="persona"><i>The name "Unlike Pluto" developed from him holding onto an outcast persona he created.</i></p>
    <p>Pluto was born in Atlanta, Georgia and now lives in Los Angeles California. When making music, he mostly focuses on the EDM and electronic rock genre. He can play several instruments such as: guitar, drums, clarinet, and piano. In recent years he has even started singing in his songs himself which amplify them so much more.</p>

    <p>Unlike Pluto is my favorite musician because he really makes an effort to put out good music everytime. He consistently puts out a song at least once every week under anyone of his stage names. These stage names include: Unlike Pluto, Like Saturn, and Why Mona. He also has very meaningful words in his songs that I love to listen to and sometimes even relate with. He sings a lot about his past with his parents and their relationship, which makes all of his songs sound strong and almost eerie.</p>
